# fMRI Responses to Musical Genres Classification in Data Scare Environment

- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) serves as a pivotal tool for comprehending brain function.
- Utilizing Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we delve into the fascinating realm of brain activity, deciphering its intricacies through the lens of blood flow dynamics. 
- Our focus lies in exploring how various musical genres influence neural pathways and activities. 
- Employing the innovative ProtoMAML framework, we tackle the complexities of analyzing neural responses within data-constrained settings, illuminating the correlations between musical genres and brain activity patterns.
